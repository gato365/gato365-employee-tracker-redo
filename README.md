# SQL Learning

This repository is to track my progress as I learn to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Example

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS).

## Technologies

* Inquirer  
* Node 
* MySQL
* Console Table

## Goals

* Understand the basics of Sequelize
* Implement CRUD methodologies
* Develop database logic using an Employee Tracker
